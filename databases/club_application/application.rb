#8.5- combining Ruby and SQL
#Arshdeep Singh

#Make a method that would create a application for people to apply to a club
#Start off by requiring the gems needed for the file to work correctly
#Create a new db and a table inside it with the correct amount of columns and rows needed
#The db should be able to execute and insert the information inside the table 
#Create a user input where the user would be asked different questions for the application
#As the user answers each questions, it would be stored into the database file 
#At the end, the database file would open which would contain all the information that the user answered from the question
