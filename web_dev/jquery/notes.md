#JQUERY PLAN/FUN



## 1. First thing i would need to do is get familiar with the concept by doing research and finding websites that would give different commands and examples on how they work. 

## 2. I would try to go in deeper by looking at different available cheatsheets that would come in handy when I start to code. 

## 3. If i find it hard, i would take a small break to clear up my mind before going back into the coding. A fresh mind always seems to work better then a stressed mind. 


#How to approach it:

## 1. Look at different examples and try to do them myself also to see how much i am able to understand and where i would need help.

## 2. Found http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/eff_animate.asp to be very good with the different examples they gave and how each one works.
